Python 3.8
Use jupyter notebook to run the code.
------------------------------------------
cut_image:
Cut the image to fit the model

Image_enhancement:
Enhance the image

Train_model:
Train the model and perform a simple evaluation
To run this code GPU is required, you can see the specific operating environment in Train_model

predict:
Input the original picture will return the running result

model_size_image_predict:
The simplified version of the prediction can only predict the cut image

Visualizing_image_channels:
Visualize each channel of the original picture, 32 channels in total

Evaluation:
Evaluate the result
